# [e-mission phone app](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/tree/master)

__This is the phone component of the e-mission system.__

:sparkles: This has now been upgraded to cordova android@12.0.0 and iOS@6.2.0. It has also been upgraded to the **latest Android & iOS versions**, **cordova-lib@10.0.0 and the most recent node and npm versions**. It also now supports CI, so we should not have any build issues in the future. __This should be ready to build out of the box.__

âœ¨ We constantly upgrade the repo to the latest cordova versions of android, iOS, cordova-lib, and the most recent node and npm versions. The CI will be up-to-date. 

For the latest versions, refer [`package.cordovabuild.json`](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/blob/fce117ff859abd995613bd405dbc7d27c703b09b/package.cordovabuild.json)

## Updating the UI only
[![osx-serve-install](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/workflows/osx-serve-install/badge.svg)](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/actions?query=workflow%3Aosx-serve-install)

If you want to make only UI changes, (as opposed to modifying the existing plugins, adding new plugins, etc), you can use the **new and improved** (as of June 2018) [e-mission dev app](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-devapp/) and install the most recent version from [releases](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-devapp/releases). 

### Installing (one-time)

1. Run the setup script

```
bash setup/setup_serve.sh
```
**(optional)** Configure by changing the files in `www/json`.
Defaults are in `www/json/*.sample`

```
ls www/json/*.sample
cp www/json/startupConfig.json.sample www/json/startupConfig.json
cp ..... www/json/connectionConfig.json
```

### Activation (after install, and in every new shell)
2. Run this to activate 
```
source setup/activate_serve.sh
```
  
### Running

1. Start the phonegap deployment server and note the URL(s) that the server is listening to.

    ```
   npm run serve
    ....
    [phonegap] listening on 10.0.0.14:3000
    [phonegap] listening on 192.168.162.1:3000
    [phonegap]
    [phonegap] ctrl-c to stop the server
    [phonegap]
    ....
    ```
  
2. Change the devapp connection URL to one of these (e.g. 192.168.162.1:3000) and press "Connect"
3. The app will now display the version of e-mission app that is in your local directory
  4. The console logs will be displayed back in the server window (prefaced by `[console]`)
  5. Breakpoints can be added by connecting through the browser
    - Safari ([enable develop menu](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-safari-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac)): Develop -> Simulator -> index.html
    - Chrome: chrome://inspect -> Remote target (emulator)
    
**Ta-da!** :gift: If you change any of the files in the `www` directory, the app will automatically be re-loaded without manually restarting either the server or the app :tada:

**Note1**: You may need to scroll up, past all the warnings about `Content Security Policy has been added` to find the port that the server is listening to.

## End to End Testing

A lot of the visualizations that we display in the phone client come from the server. In order to do end-to-end testing, we need to run a local server and connect to it. Instructions for:

1. installing a local server,
2. running it, 
3. loading it with test data, and
4. running analysis on it

are available in the [e-mission-server README](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/blob/master/README.md).

In order to make end-to-end testing easy, if the local server is started on a HTTP (versus HTTPS port), it is in development mode.  By default, the phone app connects to the local server (localhost on iOS, [10.0.2.2 on android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5806220/how-to-connect-to-my-http-localhost-web-server-from-android-emulator-in-eclips)) with the `prompted-auth` authentication method. To connect to a different server, or to use a different authentication method, you need to modify the [nrel-commute.nrel-op.json](https://github.com/e-mission/nrel-openpath-deploy-configs/blob/482971d9715e8d52862e689658f9b4f2437e6401/configs/nrel-commute.nrel-op.json) file's dynamic config. 
```
"connectUrl": "https://nrel-commute-openpath.nrel.gov/api/"
```
More details on configuring authentication [can be found in the docs](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/blob/master/docs/install/configuring_authentication.md).

One advantage of using `skip` authentication in development mode is that any user email can be entered without a password. Developers can use one of the emails that they loaded test data for in step (3) above. So if the test data loaded was with `-u shankari@eecs.berkeley.edu`, then the login email for the phone app would also be `shankari@eecs.berkeley.edu`.

## Updating the e-mission-\* plugins or adding new plugins

[![osx-build-ios](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/actions/workflows/ios-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/actions/workflows/ios-build.yml)
[![osx-build-android](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/actions/workflows/android-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/actions/workflows/android-build.yml)

__Important__

Most of the recent issues encountered have been due to incompatible setup. We
have now:
- locked down the dependencies,
- created setup and teardown scripts to setup self-contained environments with
  those dependencies, and
- CI enabled to validate that they continue work.

If you have setup failures, please compare the configuration in the **passing CI
builds** with your configuration. That is almost certainly the source of the error.

Pre-requisites
---
- The version of xcode used by the CI.
    - to install a particular version, use [xcode-select](https://www.unix.com/man-page/OSX/1/xcode-select/)
    - or this [supposedly easier to use repo](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcode-install)
- git
- Java 17. Tested with [OpenJDK 17 (Temurin) using AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptium.net). 
- Always use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) in addition to CLI
    - this allows us to install the current version of cocoapods without
      running into ruby incompatibilities - e.g.
      https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/11763

__1. Export statements__
```
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="/Users/<user_name>/Library/Android/sdk"
```
```
export ANDROID_HOME="/Users/<user_name>/Library/Android/sdk"
```
aka the path where you want the SDK to be installed. 

- android SDK; install manually or use setup script below (**recommended**). Note that you only need to run this once **per computer**.
    ```
    bash setup/prereq_android_sdk_install.sh
    ```

__2. Installing (one time only)__

- Run the setup script for the platform you want to build

```
bash setup/setup_android_native.sh
```
AND/OR
```
bash setup/setup_ios_native.sh
```

**(optional)** Configure by changing the files in `www/json`.
Defaults are in `www/json/*.sample`

```
ls www/json/*.sample
cp www/json/startupConfig.json.sample www/json/startupConfig.json
cp ..... www/json/connectionConfig.json
```

If connecting to a development server over http, make sure to turn on http support on android

```
    <edit-config file="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest/application">
        <application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"/>
    </edit-config>
```
__3. Run this in every new shell for Activation__ 

```
source setup/activate_native.sh
```
<details><summary> Expected Output </summary>

```
npm run <type_of_build>
```

For instance: (build-dev-android)
```
npm run build-dev-android
```
<details><summary> Your expected output should look something like this</summary>

```

```

</details>

## Creating logos

If you are building your own version of the app, you must have your own logo to
avoid app store conficts. Updating the logo is very simple using the [`ionic
cordova resources`](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/cli/cordova/resources/)
command.

**Note**: You may have to install the [`cordova-res` package](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-res) for the command to work

## Beta-testing debugging
If users run into problems, they have the ability to email logs to the
maintainer. These logs are in the form of an sqlite3 database, so they have to
be opened using `sqlite3`. Alternatively, you can export it to a csv with
dates using the `bin/csv_export_add_date.py` script.

```
<download the log file>
mv ~/Downloads/loggerDB /tmp/logger.<issue>
pwd
.../e-mission-phone
python bin/csv_export_add_date.py /tmp/loggerDB.<issue>
less /tmp/loggerDB.<issue>.withdate.log
```

### Troubleshooting
__1. Xcode command line tools__
```
Warning: No developer tools installed.
You should install the Command Line Tools.
```
```
xcode-select --install
```

__2. Creating Logos__
- Make sure to use `npx ionic` and `npx cordova`. This is
  because the setup script installs all the modules locally in a self-contained
  environment using `npm install` and not `npm install -g`
- Check the CI to see whether there is a known issue
- Run the commands from the script one by one and see which fails
    - compare the failed command with the CI logs
- Another workaround is to delete the local environment and recreate it
    - javascript errors: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
    - native code compile errors: `rm -rf plugins && rm -rf platforms && npx cordova prepare`

3. (For updating the e-mission-plugins or adding new plugins) **NOTE**: the basic xcode install on Catalina was messed up for me due to a prior installation of command line tools. [These workarounds helped](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md).
