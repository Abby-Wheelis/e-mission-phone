Testing Update as of 1/19/2019

Some people got recommendations but for those who weren't located in large cities, the API call resulted in a key value error. This was combatted by integrating the ProPublica API (allowing for unlimited calls using zip codes). The key value error was due to towns or a call resulting in only a zip code and not an actual city. For this reason, there was an error in giving back a suggestion. If trips are not cleaned, no suggestion will appear until the trip has been cleaned and a mode of transportation is associated with it. The suggestion system has been updated to guesstimate endpoints, since in some areas it can be difficult to pinpoint a restaurant (malls, parking lots, etc). 

Testing is ongoing and continuous. The testing files are used by sending trips directly to iPython and stepping through with a debugger. A new pull request should be sent out soon.
