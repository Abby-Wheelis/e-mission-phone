<div class="consent-text">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
I would like to invite you to take part in my research study about the transportation costs of displacement for those who are going through eviction or are moving by choice. The principal investigators for this project are Dr. Miriam Zuk, Director at the Center for Community Innovation and Lecturer in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley; and Professor Karen Chapple, Director at the Center for Community Innovation and Professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley.


<h3>Procedures</h3>
If you agree to participate, we will ask you questions about your transportation costs during two in-person visits in your moving or eviction process: before eviction or before you move, and then soon after you complete your move. During the initial in-person visit, a UC Berkeley researcher will obtain your informed consent to participate in the study and conduct the initial survey. This survey may include questions about your health, income, job, neighborhood, housing, and children’s education.

We will also install the E-Mission GPS app on your smartphone. You must agree to have the E-Mission app downloaded on your phone in order to be eligible to participate in this study. The E-Mission app tracks your location, accelerometer, battery usage, and recognizes how your phone is moving (officially known as “device-generated activity recognition”). The app uses accelerometer data and related motion sensors in your smartphone device to determine the transportation mode for the sections of your trips. Your phone accesses this information through what is referred to as the “motion and fitness” setting. Although you must permit the app to access the locational data, and motion and fitness data, you may deny the app permission to display notifications. It is necessary for study data collection for you to have "Location Services" turned on (on iOS or the equivalent on Androids). Researchers will explain this procedure during your first meeting and confirm that you are comfortable with this phone setting. Location Services (or equivalent) must be turned on for the duration of the study (i.e. at least 4 weeks).

In the app, you will then be asked to log-in using an anonymous email address and password generated by UC Berkeley researchers that will be associated with the data in place of your name. Once you have joined the User Interface for this study, the locational data from your smartphone device will be automatically transferred to the research team’s private, protected server when you are connected to Wifi. You will have E-Mission downloaded on your phone for at least the four weeks in between the first and second visit.

Between the initial and final in-person visit, we will monitor and begin analyzing smartphone app data received by the server. The final in-person visit will take place at least four weeks after the initial visit. During the final visit, we will conduct the second survey and remove the application from your phone. Before we remove the app, we will confirm that the previously mentioned “Location Services” setting has remained on since our first survey, and then we will delete the app. We expect your participation in each survey will take up to 1.5 hours, and installing and uninstalling the E-mission app will take up to 0.5 hours of your time. Altogether, participation in this study should take up to 3.5 hours of your time.

With your permission, I will audiotape and take notes during the surveys. The recording is to accurately record the information you provide, and will be used for transcription purposes only. If you choose not to be audiotaped, I will take notes instead. If you agree to being audiotaped but feel uncomfortable or change your mind for any reason during the surveys, I will turn off the recorder at your request. You may stop participating at any time and withdraw from the study without any penalty or negative impact.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
There is no direct benefit to you from taking part in this study. It is hoped that the research will help us to better understand the impacts of displacement on transportation costs and on those experiencing eviction. This knowledge will help to better inform future policy and planning efforts locally and at the state level to increase access to economic opportunities, health, and other beneficial services.

<h3>Risks/Discomforts</h3>
Some of the questions may make you uncomfortable or upset. If you agree to answer the survey, you can decline to answer a question or stop your participation at any point. Your answers and information will be handled as confidentially as possible, however, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised.

Some participants may be uncomfortable having data collected by the smartphone app. There is a very small, but nonzero risk of an unintentional breach of confidentiality associated with collecting data through the smartphone app. Discomfort will be minimized by assigning all participants a unique ID number that will be associated with the data in place of your name. You have the right to deny the app access to locational data, collection of motion and fitness data, and to display notifications when prompted during the app installation process. Please see below for steps we are taking to further minimize this risk.

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used. To minimize the risks to confidentiality, the following steps will be taken:
<ul>
	<li>Locational data collected from your smartphone will be automatically transferred to the research team’s private, protected server when you are connected to Wifi. The data will be encrypted at rest and in motion. All identifiable information from the smartphone app and surveys will either be eliminated completely or coded, the key to which will be encrypted and stored in a password protected folder on the password protected computer in the locked offices of UC Berkeley researchers. The key that links identifiable information to codes will be retained for up to five years after the end of this study.</li>
	<li>De-identified study data will be retained for the purposes of future analysis and publications for peer reviewed journals for up to five years after the end of this study.</li>
	<li>Audio recordings will be retained for up to one month following collection for the purposes of transcription and accuracy-checking of survey results. Audio recordings will be destroyed at the end of the one month period. Transcription will occur within one week of recording and transcription records will be kept for up to five years.</li>
	<li>If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
To thank you for participating in this study, you will receive a debit gift card up to $125. The full $125 compensation reflects successful installation of the smartphone application, completing two surveys, and uninstalling the app. If you choose to end your participation early, we will mail you a $40 gift card. The minimum participation required to be eligible for partial participation compensation is downloading the phone application and beginning (though not necessarily completing) the first in-person survey. Any participation beyond this, short of full participation, also qualifies as "partial participation," and makes you eligible for the $40 gift card as compensation for your time. If you download the application, after agreeing to the study protocol of keeping Location Services turned on on iOS (or the Android equivalent), and accidentally turn off access to locational services or motion data, but meet all other full participation requirements, you are still eligible for full participation compensation.  I will mail you the gift card immediately after we complete the second survey and uninstall the GPS app from your phone.

<h3>Rights</h3>
<b><i>Participation in research is completely voluntary</i></b>. You are free to decline to take part in the project. You can decline to answer any questions and are free to stop taking part in the project at any time.  Whether or not you choose to participate in the research and whether or not you choose to answer a question or continue participating in the project, there will be no penalty to you or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled, and it will have no impact on your standing, current or future services at the TENDERLOIN NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING CLINIC.
