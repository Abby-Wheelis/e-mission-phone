<h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
All data collected by this app will be sent to a public server that will make
it available openly.  The server is maintained by <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~shankari">K. Shankari</a> under the
supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~culler/">Prof. David
Culler</a>. The data can be downloaded via standard REST APIs and be used for
any purpose whatsoever. There is also a public ipython server that allows the
world to explore the data directly. This open data, along with published
notebooks that manipulate the data, will aid reproducibility. For more details,
see https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/blob/master/README.zephyr.md

<h3>What we collect</h3>
If you leave the tracking on, we automatically track the phone's location,
accelerometer, device-generated activity recognition, and battery usage. If you
turn tracking off, we only track battery usage. We also allow you to optionally
enter your experiences and feedback during travel through the app. Since our
code is open source, you can inspect the data that we collect in the background
at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>,
explore the prompts for optional sentiment reporting at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone.git</a>,
and see the analysis that we perform at <a

<h3>How we associate it with you</h3>
You log in to the app using label that you create. We map the label to a unique
UUID and associate all collected data with the UUID. The mapping between the
label and the UUID is publicly available, and any user can retrieve all data
associated with a particular label. This is not secure against malicious users
- since all labels are public, a malicious user can also send data with an
existing label using the REST API. Ensure that your published notebooks always
use time ranges for the data that you sent.

<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
The data is open and publicly available.
