<h3>Introduction</h3>
Through the Utilizing Location History Data to Develop Travel Demand Prediction
Models project (“Research Project”), funded by the U.S. Department of Energy,
Vehicle Technologies Office, the research team at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory plans to explore the viability of location history (LH) data to
model individual travel patterns. Using LH data, the Research Project team
plans to develop machine learning (ML)-based predictive models to forecast
travel behavior of individuals.

LH data (coupled with a small survey to solicit socio-demographic information)
will be collected from a small sample of pre-selected individuals through
NREL-Lo-Hi, an open-sourced smart phone application (“App”). The National
Renewable Energy Laboratory is a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of
Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, operated by Alliance
for Sustainable Energy, LLC under Prime Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308. This
Privacy Policy applies to the App provided by Alliance for Sustainable Energy,
LLC. This App is provided solely for the Research Project. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DELETE THE APP.


<h3>Purpose</h3>
LH data coupled with socio-demographic info will be used to develop a suite of
generic ML-based predictive models for forecasting:
<ol>
<li> ✔️  Activity-type choice, i.e., what types of activities will an individual participate in during a day
<li> ✔️  Departure time choice, i.e., at what time the individual start traveling to each activity
<li> ✔️  Mode choice, i.e., which mode an individual used to travel to an activity
</ol>

<h3>What we collect</h3>
By participating in this Research Project, you agree to allow us to track
metrics pertaining to your location, accelerometer, device-generated activity
and mode recognition, App usage time and battery usage. We will also ask that
you enter your experiences and feedback using daily surveys.


Furthermore, there will be an initial survey to collect your sociodemographic
information. We assure you that your information will never be made public or
sold, and is collected only for the purposes of the Research Project . The
Research Project was determined to be exempt from Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approval. The sociodemographic information you provide will never be
used for any commercial purposes.


We use an open source platform, e-mission, to operate the App, and for the data
collection. You can inspect the data that e-mission collects in the background
at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>,
and view the configuration for this study at <a

<h3>How we associate it with you</h3>
A randomly generated token will be generated by the App during onboarding and
used for all further communication with the server. Only the individual
participant will have access to the relationship between the token key and the
participant. This means that if you switch phones or uninstall and reinstall
the App, you will not have access to your prior data.


<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
Only researchers working on the Research Project will have access to the raw
data. Data collected through the Research Project will not be shared outside
the core research team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Any
research related requests for processed data will be handled on a case-by-case
basis, and even in the case that data is shared with outside researchers, only
aggregated and anonymized versions of the data will be shared.


<h3>Your rights</h3>
<b><i>Participation in the Research Project is completely voluntary</i></b>.
You have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in the
Research Project without providing notice to the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory or the principal investigator. If you would like to have your data
destroyed (and not included in the Research Project), please contact the
principal investigator requesting such deletion. Include your token in the
request for deletion. We will then destroy all data associated with that token
and such data will not be included in the Research Project. Because we do not
connect your identity with your token, we cannot delete your information
without you providing the token in your deletion request. If you do not wish
to participate in the Research Project, please delete the App. You will not be
compensated for your participation in the Research Project.

<h3>Questions</h3>
If you have any questions about this research, please contact the
principal investigator of the project at <a
