<h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
	Thank you for installing e-mission. e-mission will collect data on your location and speed to make inferences about your trip such as mode choice.

ELCITA would like to invite you to take part in the research study about travel behavior of Electronics City commuters and residents. The principal investigator of this project is Professor Abdul Rawoof Pinjari. 
<h3>Procedures</h3>
If you agree to participate, we will ask you to answer questions about your travel patterns, modes of travel, common destinations, employment, income, and other factors. You will also be asked to fill out a travel log for a period of 1 day of everywhere you go and how you got there. In total, filling out the survey and travel log should last a maximum of 1.5 hours. In addition to the travel log and survey, we will ask you to download a GPS app onto your smartphone. The GPS app will collect your location for a period of seven continuous days for the purposes of better understanding information collected in the survey and travel log. You are free not to participate in the study.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
There is no direct benefit to you from taking part in this study. It is hoped that the research will help us to better understand the impacts of living in affordable housing near transit on greenhouse gas emissions as well as other benefits. This knowledge will help to better inform future policy and planning efforts locally and at the State regarding the location of affordable housing and access to transportation options.

<h3>Risks/Discomforts</h3>
Some of the questions may make you uncomfortable or upset. If you agree to participate in the study and feel uncomfortable at any time, you can decline to answer a question or stop your participation at any point. Your answers and information will be handled as confidentially as possible; however, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised.
