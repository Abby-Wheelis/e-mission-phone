<h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
All data collected by this version of app will be sent to a shared server
maintained by the research group of <a
href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez">Marta
González</a>. The data will be part of a shared dataset that will be made
available to all contributors.

<h3>What we collect</h3>
If you leave the tracking on, we automatically track the phone's location,
accelerometer, device-generated activity recognition, and battery usage. If you
turn tracking off, we only track battery usage. We also allow you to optionally
enter your experiences and feedback during travel through the app. Since our
code is open source, you can inspect the data that we collect in the background
at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>,
explore the prompts for optional sentiment reporting at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone.git</a>,
and see the analysis that we perform at <a

<h3>How we associate it with you</h3>
You log in to the app using your email. We map the email to a unique UUID and
associate all collected data with the UUID. Although the data is only
associated with a UUID, the mapping between the email and the UUID will be part
of the shared dataset and can be accessed by all contributors.

<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
All contributors to the dataset receive access to the collected data.

<h3>Questions</h3>
If you have any questions about the data collected, please feel free to contact
