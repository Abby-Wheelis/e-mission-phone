<h3>Introduction</h3>
Through this project, the research team plans to explore the viability of
location history (LH) data to model individual travel patterns. Using LH data,
the project team plans to develop machine learning (ML)-based predictive models
to forecast travel behavior of individuals. LH data (coupled with a small
survey to solicit socio-demographic information) will be collected from a small
sample of individuals through emTripLog, an open-sourced smart phone
application.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
LH data coupled with socio-demographic info will be used to develop a suite of
generic ML-based predictive models for forecasting:
<ol>
<li> ✔️  Activity-type choice, i.e., what types of activities will an individual participate in during a day
<li> ✔️  Departure time choice, i.e., at what time the individual start traveling to each activity
<li> ✔️  Mode choice, i.e., which mode an individual used to travel to an activity
</ol>

<h3>What we collect</h3>
By participating in this program, you agree to allow us to track metrics
pertaining to your location, accelerometer, device-generated activity and mode
recognition, app usage time and battery usage. We will also ask that you enter
your experiences and feedback during daily surveys.

Furthermore, there will be an initial survey to collect your sociodemographic
information. We would like to assure you that your information will never be
made public or sold, and is collected only for the purposes of this project
without any commercial third party involvement.

We use an open source platform, e-mission and the associated emTripLog app, for
the data collection. You can inspect the data that e-mission collects in the
background at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>,
and view the configuration for this pilot at <a

<h3>How we associate it with you</h3>
Each participant’s phone will be associated with a randomly generated token
that is stored on the server on registration. Nobody other than the participant
will have access to the relationship between the token key and the participant.
This means that if you switch phones or uninstall and reinstall the app, you
will not have access to your prior data.

<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
Only researchers working on this project will have access to the raw data. Data
collected through this project will not be shared with anyone outside the core
research team. Any research related requests for processed data will be handled
on a case-by-case basis, and even in the case that data is shared with outside
researchers, only aggregated and anonymized versions of the data will be
shared.

<h3>Your rights</h3>
<b><i>Participation in research is completely voluntary</i></b>.  You have the
right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in this study
without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
