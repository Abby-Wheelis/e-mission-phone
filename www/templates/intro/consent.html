<h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
	Thank you for installing e-mission. e-mission will collect data on your location and speed to make inferences about your trip such as mode choice. <b>Please keep e-mission on your phone for at least two days. At the end of two days, you are requested to pull up your trips and answer questions to confirm inferences made by e-mission.</b>
	
	
	
		
		
ELCITA would like to invite you to take part in the research study about travel behavior of Electronics City commuters and residents. The principal investigator of this project is Professor Abdul Rawoof Pinjari. 
<h3>Procedures</h3>
If you agree to participate, we will ask you to answer questions about your travel patterns, modes of travel, common destinations, employment, income, and other factors. You will also be asked to fill out a travel log for a period of 1 day of everywhere you go and how you got there. In total, filling out the survey and travel log should last a maximum of 1.5 hours. In addition to the travel log and survey, we will ask you to download a GPS app onto your smartphone. The GPS app will collect your location for a period of seven continuous days for the purposes of better understanding information collected in the survey and travel log. You are free not to participate in the study.
<br>
<b>Please turn on your location services while traveling. The application automatically turns on GPS only when you are moving, so it will not drain your battery.</b>
<br><br>
Researchers of the Center for infrastructure, Sustainable Transport and Urban Planning (CiSTUP) of IISc will analyze this data. Your survey responses will be stored securely and will not be shared with individuals or organizations outside CiSTUP, unless compelled by the law.

<br><br>
A report from this research (with aggregate analysis of this survey data, not individual information) will be shared with ELCITA if you would like to know how the survey data is used to ease your travel in the City.
