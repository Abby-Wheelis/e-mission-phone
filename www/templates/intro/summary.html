	This version of E-Mission is designed to record your travel behavior for a period of at least four weeks in order to calculate your Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT). The application will collect trip location data, travel speed, and estimate mode of travel such as walking, biking, or vehicle. All data collected is used solely for the research study at UC Berkeley's Center for Community Innovation, entitled, "Using GPS Tracking to Understand the Transportation Costs of Displacement: A San Francisco Pilot."
